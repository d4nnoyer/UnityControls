# UnityControls

WinForms application with integrated Unity-standalone executables and console-window for researching reinforcement learning algorithms (PPO, SAC + BC, GAIL) using ML-Agents package. 


This repository may be useful for those who are looking for examples of:
-  Interprocess communication via NamedPipes
-  Embedding a standalone Unity executable
-  Embedding a console application
-  Importing new .onnx-model into ML-Agent in runtime
